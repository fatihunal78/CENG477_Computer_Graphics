I prepared the homework in open gl and used visual studio c++.

The nodes represent the machines in the network and the lines represent the connections between them.
Creates a new black node with the right mouse button.
Marks the nearest node with the left mouse button. The selected node turns red.
With the middle mouse button, a connection is created between the selected node and the closest node to the point where the mouse is marked.
If the mouse is dragged while the left mouse button is pressed, the selected node will be moved. All connected lines also move with that node.
Any line can be marked with the middle key of moesu.
My program has nothing else.
